This is a cloud fomration to enable easy management for AWS community Developer Portal 
`https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-developer-portal.html#apigateway-developer-portal-create`

The initial Developer Portal has to use command line to do deployment and management. It does not give the flexibility to be part of cloud formation. 
This project customerizes the Developer Portal to cloud formation, which can be used for integrating with other products, workflows, and automations. 

The key contributions:
1. Architecture of the Cloud Formationized Developer Portal
2. Cloud Formation definitions, security ROLE definitions
3. Lambda to create, update, delete the Cloud Formation interacting with Cloud Formation custom resource
